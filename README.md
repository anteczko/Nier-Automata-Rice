# Nier-Automata-Rice
It's repository for game inspired linux customization.

I'm sharing it so everybody can take a look at, but I don't guarantee this config files will work on your machine, and it doesn't have any autoinstall/autodeploy script.
Also I'm gona share screenshots of it on /r/unixporn, and maybe if you had any questions, they may been already answered in the comments of this post.
