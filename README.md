#### Programs used: 
* i3wm - window manager
* polybar - displaying a bar with workspaces
* compton - composition manager (it adds this nice shadows under windows)
* conky - it display configurable info wiget
* firefox - because i made custom css for it

I'm sharing it so everybody can take a look at, but I don't guarantee this config files will work on your machine, and it doesn't have any autoinstall/autodeploy script.
Also I'm gona share screenshots of it on /r/unixporn, and maybe if you had any questions, they may been already answered in the comments of this post.
